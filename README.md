### Reinforcement learning for complex goals
- An agent receives a state (s) from the environment
- Produces an action (a)
#### Given this state and action pair, the environment provides:
- A new state (sâ€²)
- A reward (r)

### Reinforcement learning using Q-learning
- We learn a direct mapping between state and action pairs (s,a) and value estimations (v)
- The value estimation should correspond to the discounted expected reward over time from taking action (a) while in state (s)
- Using the Bellman equation, we can iteratively update our estimations of Q(s,a) for all possible state action pairs
